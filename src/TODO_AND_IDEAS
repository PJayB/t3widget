- restructure the code. There is lots of code in places that it should not be.
	First thing to do is to define how it should be...
- put everything in a namespace (t3 sounds about right, or maybe even
	t3::window)
- figure out which dialogs should be included as defaults, and which should be
	part of tilde/edit
- move the casefolding stuff into libt3unicode
- refine the editwindow/file/line stuff into an edit widget
- put all the dialog output into a single window (unwritten positions are see-
	through anyway!)
- add a test program to check if everything works
- figure out how to get rid of the bullet_status_t interface
- rename the multi_string_list_i interface to something ending in _t
