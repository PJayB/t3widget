Introduction
============

The libt3widget library provides a C++ dialog toolkit. It provides objects for
dialogs and widgets like buttons, text fields, check boxes etc., to facilitate
easy construction of dialog based programs for Un*x terminals.

libt3widget is part of the Tilde Terminal Toolkit (T3)
[http://os.ghalkes.nl/t3/]


Prerequisites and installation
==============================

libt3widget requires the libtool utility to be compiled. Furthermore, it
requires libtranscript, libt3unicode, libt3key, libt3window and libsigc++ (2.0
or newer).

There are two ways in which to compile libt3widget:

Using the configure script:
---

$ ./configure
or
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
(see ./configure --help for more tuning options)
$ make all
$ make install
(assumes working install program)

Manually editing the Makefile to suit your computer:
---

$ cp Makefile.in Makefile

Edit the values for the different variables, using the comments in the
Makefile for guidance, to suit your environment.

$ make all
$ make install
(assumes working install program)

The Makefile in the distribution should work on all POSIX compatible make's.
It has been tested using both GNU make and BSD make.


Reporting bugs
==============

If you think you have found a bug, please check that you are using the latest
version of libt3widget [http://os.ghalkes.nl/t3/libt3widget.html]. When
reporting bugs, please include a minimal example that demonstrates the problem.
